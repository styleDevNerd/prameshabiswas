        <p><span class="letter-h">H</span>ey, My name is Pramesha Biswas. I am Computer Science Engineer.
          I am working
          in a well know MNC from the
          past 3+ years as a Sr. Software Engineer. I am a CSS Enthusiast.
        </p>
        <p>In my 10th, i first learned what is HTML and made my first website. Then in 12th, i learned C++ and was
          mesmerized with this world of programming. I was always enthusiastic to learn new programming languages. After
          completing my college i got placed in an MNC and was trained in .Net. But after learning so many languages and
          investing so many years i realized that i have different passion for HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>During the lockdown everyone was doing something new around me and I entered the world of Twitter and found
          so
          many people who were taking this #100daysofcode. This motivated me to start with my passion.
        </p>
        <p>I took #dailycssimages challenge and i learned soo much that i decided to give a shot to #100daysofcode
          challenge. And during this period it was clear that Front-end Web Developer and Desinger are the fields i
          wanna explore and master.
        </p>
        <p>Below are my skills. Currently I'm Mastering JS and learning React.</p>
